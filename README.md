# Malhun Contour Map

This project draws contour lines from a selection of Moroccan *malhun* poems.
It coincides with a research project carried out by Christopher Witulski, presented at
the 2016 Analytical Approaches to World Music conference in New York City.

The tool is also available for use by scholars interested in this type of work as
a command line Python library. More information is at [ContourViz](https://github.com/cjwit/contourviz).
