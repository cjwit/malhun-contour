# Malhun Contour Map

This project draws contour lines from a selection of Moroccan *malhun* poems.
It coincides with a research project carried out by Christopher Witulski, presented at
the 2016 Analytical Approaches to World Music conference in New York City.

See the [web interface](https://cjwit.github.io/malhun-contour/index.html) for this project.

The tool is also available for use by scholars interested in this type of work as
a command line Python library. More information is at [ContourViz](https://github.com/cjwit/contourviz).
